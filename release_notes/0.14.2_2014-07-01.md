## 0.14.0

* ghapi returns an object after it is called. 
    * The object has 3 fields
        * `ghApi` - the router used by ghApi
        * `ghCore` - a configured instance of ghCore used by ghApi
        * `bridgetown` - a configure instance of bridgetwon used by ghApi
    * Returning `ghCore` removes the need to tie the ghCore and ghApi version numbers, since by using the `ghCore` returned
        from ghApi, the user is guaranteed the same version (and instance) of ghCore as ghApi is using.
    
* calling ghApi with a truthy value will simply return the router used by ghApi
    * at this point it is up to the user to mount and use the router as desired (see example below)
* ghapi now uses its own router
    * this modularizes ghapi so its middleware doesn't interfere with other routers
    * the returned router must be used (with an optional mount path) on an express app
    
        ```javascript
        // with no api prefix
        expressApp.use(ghApi('use proxy').ghApi);
        
        // with a custom prefix
        expressApp.use('my/v1/api', ghApi('use proxy').ghApi);
        ```
